Fine-tuned ion transport across nanoscale pores is key to many biological processes, including neurotransmission. Recent advances have enabled the confinement of water and ions to two dimensions, unveiling transport properties inaccessible at larger scales and triggering hopes of reproducing the ionic machinery of biological systems. Here we report experiments demonstrating the emergence of memory in the transport of aqueous electrolytes across (sub)nanoscale channels. We unveil two types of nanofluidic memristors depending on channel material and confinement, with memory ranging from minutes to hours. We explain how large time scales could emerge from interfacial processes such as ionic self-assembly or surface adsorption. Such behavior allowed us to implement Hebbian learning with nanofluidic systems. This result lays the foundation for biomimetic computations on aqueous electrolytic chips.

O
ver the past decade, research in nanofluidics has shed light on many unconventional phenomena arising in the
transport of water and ions through
nanometric channels (1–12). The field
has grown at a fast pace, driven by the discovery of previously unknown fundamental behaviors of aqueous transport at nanoscale, and also by potential applications, from water desalination to energy harvesting (2). Most notably, the recent development of twodimensional (2D) channels, made by van der Waals assembly of various materials [graphite, hexagonal boron nitride, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), etc.], has enabled the study of ionic transport at the smallest scales, with unmatched versatility in terms of geometry or surface properties (13–16). Specifics of 2D interactions offer a new asset to fine-tune the properties of electrolytes, at odds with their bulk response. A recent, notable prediction is that 2D ionic self-assembly should be at the root of memory effects associated with conductance hysteresis under electrical forcing (17), a phenomenon known as the memristor effect. This effect could allow the emulation of the brain's neuronal computation using ions in water as charge carriers, but artificial systems capable of mimicking this behavior have eluded experimental inquiry in aqueous electrolytes until now.

tory of voltage seen by the system, thereby modifying its conductance (18, 19). As this feature makes them the analogs of biological synapses, memristors have drawn considerable attention for their potential use as building blocks of bioinspired neuromorphic computers (20). However, most of the existing examples are based on solid-state devices (such as the metallic-insulator-metallic architecture) and function with coupled ion and electron dynamics (21). Although a handful of fluidic memristors were also designed (22–24), they require high voltage to operate, well above the water-splitting threshold (1.23 V with respect to a normal hydrogen electrode), use nonaqueous environments, or far exceed the nanoscale dimensions of biological systems. More generally, a challenge is to replicate the mechanism found in biological systems, where the transport and accumulation of solvated ions (notably calcium) in water are used for signalization, information processing, and the building of memory (25, 26). Developing such bioinspired memristors would enable the designing of artificial nanofluidic chips for neuromorphic computation, the building of an interface between artificial nanofluidics and biological systems, and the exploration of possible gains in efficiency from using solvated ions as charge carriers. Here we report on a series of experiments demonstrating that 2D nanofluidic channels do open this avenue toward neuromorphic iontronics.

#### Experimental demonstration of nanofluidic memristors Pristine MoS2 channels versus activated carbon channels

In this work, we investigated two types of 2D nanochannels of similar geometry but different surface properties (Fig. 1A). "Pristine" channels, the first type, were made of two atomically smooth flakes of 2D material ([here,](http://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1126%2Fscience.adc9931&domain=pdf&date_stamp=2023-01-12) MoS2) separated by an array of multiple layers

of graphene nanoribbons used as spacers. "Activated" carbon channels, the second type, consisted of two graphite flakes, in which a nanoscale trench was milled into the bottom flake using electron beam–induced etching (EBIE) (16). In both cases, the bottom wall of the channel was pierced and deposited on the aperture of a SiN<sup>x</sup> membrane. Further details regarding the fabrication of activated and pristine channels can be found in (13) and (16), respectively, and are summarized in the supplementary materials (SM; figs. S1 and S2). Although similar in design, these channels differed on a few key properties. The height of pristine MoS2 channels could be precisely controlled in increments of 0.34 nm and, here, down to 0.68 nm—the channel's depth corresponding to the spacers' thickness. Conversely, the depth of activated carbon channels was controlled by EBIE with a resolution limited to a few nanometers. As recently demonstrated by Emmerich et al. (16), the latter carries a much stronger surface charge compared with pristine walls, owing to the exposure of their bottom wall to the electron beam. We used activated carbon channels with a channel height of between 4 and 13 nm and pristine MoS2 channels with a height of between 0.68 and 86 nm.

Once fabricated, the 2D channels were embedded in a fluidic cell connected to two reservoirs filled with an electrolyte (KCl, NaCl, LiCl, CaCl2, NiSO4, or AlCl3). Salt concentrations between 1 mM and 3 M were tested. Unless stated otherwise, the solution's pH was not modified after salt dissolution in deionized water, resulting in a pH range of 5.1 to 5.5, depending on salt concentration. A patchclamp amplifier (Keithley 2400 or 2600 Series) connected to Ag/AgCl electrodes allowed for ionic current measurements under imposed time-dependent voltage drop V(t) of various frequencies (0.1 to 200 mHz), shapes (sinusoidal, triangular), and amplitudes (0.1 to 1 V). In each case, the channel's conductance G(t) was determined from current measurements from an instantaneous Ohm's law  $G(t) = I(t)$ / V(t). Further details regarding current measurements are reported in the SM. Typical examples of experimental results for both types of systems are shown in Fig. 1.

#### Two types of memristors

Our central result is that 2D nanofluidic channels did exhibit a memristive effect (Fig. 1, B to E). When probed by a time-varying voltage, they displayed a nonlinear current-voltage (I-V) characteristic, which was pinched at zero voltage, associated with a conductance hysteresis. This pinched loop under periodic forcing is the hallmark of memristors (27). Such behavior was found in both types of channels pristine and activated—for all tested electrolytes

nanofluidic devices. (A) Sketch of the nanofluidic cell. A nanochannel was deposited on a membrane separating two reservoirs filled with an electrolytic solution. The red arrow indicates the path taken by water and ions across the system. We used two types of nanochannels: pristine MoS2 channels (bottom left panel) and activated carbon channels (bottom right panel). (B and C) Typical examples of memristive current-voltage (*I-V*) and conductance-voltage (*G-V*) characteristics of a pristine MoS2 channel (height  $h = 1$  nm) under periodic voltage (triangular wave of frequency 8 mHz, using 3 M KCl). The I-V curve displays a loop that is pinched (but does not intersect) at the origin, and the *G-V* curve has a crossing point at zero voltage. (D and E) Typical examples of memristive current-voltage and conductance-voltage characteristics of an activated carbon channel (height  $h = 13$  nm) under periodic voltage (sinusoidal wave of frequency 1 mHz, using 1 mM CaCl2). Here, the *I-V* curve crosses itself at the origin, and the *G-V* curve takes the form of a simple loop. For all data, pH was not modified after salt dissolution in deionized water, resulting in a pH range of 5.1 to 5.5.

and at all salt concentrations (see SM for full results). The memristive effect was found to take place at frequencies between 0.1 and 200 mHz, well below frequencies where capacitive effects can introduce hysteresis. This result corresponds to dynamical time scales from seconds to hours. Moreover, the phenomenon was found to be robust and was observed in a wide range of parameters—notably salt concentration, channel height, and pH (figs. S9 to S16). All tested salts displayed the same phenomenology. Specifically, we did not observe substantially different results with multivalent salts under the tested experimental conditions, suggesting that the materials used here (MoS2 and activated carbon) are not subject to phenomena such as charge reversal that are commonly observed with divalent ions such as calcium (28). Our activated carbon channels typically displayed an overall conductance much higher than what could be expected from bulk estimates, owing to their high surface charge and hydrodynamic slippage (16).

Further, we could identify two types of memristors, depending on whether the currentvoltage characteristics did or did not self-cross at the origin [compare Fig. 1B (pristine MoS2 channel) and Fig. 1D (activated carbon channel)]. This fundamental difference is best illustrated by looking at the curve of conductance as a function of voltage: It either displayed a twisted loop [with one crossing point (Fig. 1C)] or an open loop [no crossing point (Fig. 1E)]. Following the terminology introduced in (27), we classified our experimental data as follows: Systems that exhibited a self-crossing *I-V* curve (Fig. 1, D and E) were referred to as bipolar memristors. Conversely, those that instead displayed a self-crossing conductancevoltage (G-V) curve (Fig. 1, B and C) were referred to as unipolar memristors.

A key aspect of memristors is their ability to switch between different internal conductance states. We observed that bipolar memristors changed conductance state when the polarity of voltage was reversed, with, for example, maximum conductance at +1 V and minimum conductance at -1 V (Fig. 1E)—thus the name "bipolar." On the other hand, unipolar memristors generally exhibited symmetric  $I$ - $V$  and G-V curves that were strongly nonlinear when the amplitude of voltage was increased. Their conductance only weakly depended on voltage polarity but could vary by up to two orders of magnitude between voltage  $V = 0$  and  $V$  =  $\pm 1$  V (Fig. 1C)—thus the name “unipolar.” Together, these facts indicate that the possible internal states of unipolar and bipolar memristors were fundamentally different.

In addition, thinner pristine devices (with a channel height  $h < 10$  nm) could display either kind of behavior, depending on salt concentration (with unipolar memristors at 0.1 M or higher). Thicker pristine MoS2 channels, on the other hand, only displayed a weak bipolar memristor effect; however, the memory effect was not as notable as that observed in thinner channels, implying that confinement in a 2D geometry is essential for attaining memory effects. Lastly, the phenomenon was found to be weakened at acidic pH in both types of systems. All corresponding data are provided in the SM (figs. S9 to S16).

This comparison sheds light on a possible explanation. Bipolar memristors were observed

Fig. 2. Theory of nanofluidic memristors. (A and B) Description of the different conductance states explaining the memristor effect. (A) Wien effect as a source of the unipolar memristor effect. Under strong confinement, ions assemble into nonconducting Bjerrum pairs. Conduction can then occur through the breaking of pairs (Wien effect) or their clustering into conducting arcs (polyelectrolytic Wien effect), under the action of a strong electric field (regardless of sign). (B) Entry effects as a source of the bipolar memristor effect. The two mouths of the channel are asymmetric, resulting in ionic rectification depending on the side from which charges enter the system. If they enter from the side of low resistance, ions accumulate and conductance rises. Otherwise, the channel is depleted and conductance is lowered. As the channel's walls bear a strong negative charge, only positive ions are represented here. (C and D) Effective "stop-and-go" transport and long-term memory. In both mechanisms (Wien effect or geometrical asymmetry), the system's conductance state can be retained over large time scales if transport is governed by a stop-and-go motion, induced by repeated pairing-unpairing or adsorption-desorption events, respectively.

for high surface charges (as found in activated carbon channels) and low salt concentration in other words, for surface-dominated conduction. In contrast, unipolar memristors were observed for moderate surface charge (pristine MoS2 channels), high salt concentration, and strong confinement; these results corresponded to a "confinement-dominated"regime. In both cases, a prerequisite for memory effects was the system's ability to display nonlinear ion transport. Accordingly, we next focus on the description of the system's various conductance states as a function of applied voltage.

#### Two sources of nonlinearity: Collective ionic transport and ionic rectification

The above observations suggested the existence of two distinct mechanisms behind the memristive behavior of nanofluidic channels. Unipolar memristors only existed in thin channels ( $h < 10$  nm) and at high salt concentration ( $c \geq 0.1$  M), and the corresponding experimental results directly echoed the theoretical mechanisms discussed in [\(17\)](#page-1-7). In this picture, a nonlinear response can be accounted for by the formation of tightly bound Bjerrum pairs of ions if confinement is sufficiently strong (and the solution not too diluted), preventing conduction (Fig. 2A). The application of a sufficiently strong electric field can break these pairs or assemble them into an arc-like polyelectrolyte, allowing, in both cases, electrical current to flow, a process known as the (second) Wien effect. As a result, the system's conductance G is a strongly nonlinear function of voltage V that almost vanishes in the absence of voltage, behaving as

$$G(V)^{\infty} |V|^{a} \tag{1}$$

with a predicted exponent  $\alpha > 1$ , and usually around 2 [see SM, section 3, and [\(17\)](#page-1-7) for the derivation]. We can take into account the fact that not all ions may be paired up by adding a small constant term G<sup>0</sup> =  $G(V = 0)$  into the above equation. This mechanism is independent of voltage sign and thus does correspond to a unipolar memristor. It also allows the conductance to vary continuously over a large range of values, accounting for experimental observations. In theory, this process can only take place in thinner channels—those less than 2 nm in thickness—as Bjerrum pairs only exist under strong confinement. In practice, the transition from unipolar to bipolar behavior was found to take place around a thickness of 10 nm. A possible explanation for this robustness is that ion pairs could still exist in the few water layers next to the channel's walls, even in slightly larger channels; in particular, the presence of a wall tends to lower the dielectric constant of the first water layers (29), and ions are thus expected to experience stronger electrostatic interactions near surfaces. If that is the case, then ionic pairing near solid surfaces could be relevant in other contexts, and their dynamics could be probed for with similar time-varying voltage.

On the other hand, bipolar devices changed state depending on the polarity of the applied voltage, and their memory should therefore stem from an internal asymmetry. However, in some experimental conditions, pristine MoS2 channels did display this kind of hysteresis despite their internal surface being atomically smooth and controlled. Therefore, we attributed the source of asymmetry to entrance effects. By construction, the SiN<sup>x</sup> membrane was present on one side of the device only (Fig. 1A), and the two mouths of the channel did not have the same access resistance. Coupled with the exclusion of anions from the channel (due to its strong negative surface charge), this result is expected to result in ionic rectification (Fig. 2B and fig. S6). When cations flow from the side with lower access resistance, ions will accumulate inside the channel because entry is "easier" than exit, resulting in a conductance increase. If voltage is reversed, cations will flow from the side of higher resistance, the channel will instead be depleted, and conductance will drop. This mechanism is analogous to that of a p–n junction and results in a diode-like current-voltage characteristic (30) with two distinct possible values of conductance, defining a rectification factor  $\beta\_{\text{Rect}}$ 

$$\frac{G(V>0)}{G(V<0)} \simeq \mathfrak{h}\_{\text{Rect}}\tag{2}$$

Experimentally, we found  $\beta\_{\text{Rect}}$  = 1 to 5, consistent with the above analysis in terms of entry effects (see SM, section 3). Because this type of nonlinearity depends on voltage sign, it corresponds to a bipolar memristor.

We stress that these two phenomena were not mutually exclusive; pristine MoS2 channels could show signs of both mechanisms at

Fig. 3. Comparison of theoretical models and experimental results. (A and B) Fit of experimental *I-V* curves using the minimal model of the nanofluidic memristor. For unipolar memristors (**A**), the quasistatic conductance was taken to be a power law of applied voltage (here with exponent  $\alpha = 2$ ), and a sign-dependent constant in the bipolar case (**B**) (see insets). The experimental curves were then fitted using the delay time t as single free parameter (see Eq. 4). Datasets correspond to devices presented in Fig. 1, B to E: 3 M KCl in pristine MoS2 channel (height *h* = 1 nm) or

1 mM CaCl2 in activated carbon channel (height *h* = 13 nm). (**C**) Normalized area of the *I-V* loop as a function of voltage frequency. Data correspond to 100 mM CaCl2 in 4 nm activated carbon channel and 1 M KCl in 0.68 nm pristine MoS2 channel. The memory time scale  $\tau\_m$  could be extracted from experimental data by looking for the frequency where the loop was the largest. The curve of the loop area as a function of frequency was well described by that of the minimal model [see eq. S38 in the SM; solid lines]. See fig. S8 for the normalization process.

the same time. In such cases, the *I-V* curve displayed two crossing points (rather than one or none). Further analysis and experimental data can be found in the SM (section 3.4 and fig. S17).

Although any system presenting a sufficiently strong nonlinearity associated with various internal conductance states could in theory display memristive behavior, it can only do so within a frequency range fixed by the time required to switch between the conducting and the insulating states. However, such time scales are normally too short to be accessible in nanofluidic systems, and this phenomenon requires peculiar transport processes to be observed.

#### Stop-and-go transport as a source of long-term memory

For both types of memristors, memory time scales were found to reach extremely large values, in the range of minutes to hours. Such long-term memory could be accounted for by taking ion pairing or surface adsorption into account in the dynamics of confined ions. In the theoretical framework of (17), the electrolyte is indeed predicted to retain its conductance state through the formation of ion clusters, which was estimated to typically take a few milliseconds. More generally, one expects a nanofluidic channel to retain a conductance state (defined by the number of charge carriers present inside the channel) over a typical diffusion time scale, roughly  $L^2/D$ , where *L* is the channel length and *D* is a typical ionic diffusion coefficient in the channel. For channels with a length of ~10 μm, this result would yield a maximum memory time of 0.1 s, which is still orders of magnitude lower than experimental values. However, this picture changes

if interfacial processes, rather than diffusion, govern ion transport. Consider a particle diffusing through a channel with chemically-active walls, such that it may adsorb on the surface (Fig. 2D). If the adsorption rate is much larger than the diffusion rate across the channel, then the particle will spend most of its time bound to the surface. As a result, the time it needs to escape the pore is the sum of the durations of all adsorption events. Let us define  $\tau\_{\text{diff}}$  as the time needed to escape through diffusion alone and t<sup>d</sup> as the time a particle bound to the surface takes to desorb. Then, if the particle is adsorbed every  $\tau\_a$  «  $\tau\_{\text{diff}}$ , there will be  $\tau\_{\text{diff}}/\tau\_a$  such events along the particle's trajectory as it crosses the channel. As a result, the system's memory time tm, given by the residence of the particle inside the pore, reads

$$
\tau\_{\rm m} = \frac{\tau\_{\rm diff}}{\tau\_{\rm a}} \tau\_{\rm d} = \frac{\tau\_{\rm d}}{\tau\_{\rm a}} \tau\_{\rm diff} \gg \tau\_{\rm diff} \tag{3}
$$

In other words, the memory time of the system is the diffusion time scale multiplied by a ratio  $\tau\_d/\tau\_a$  measuring the strength of surface effects. At chemical equilibrium, this condition corresponds to the ratio of particle numbers on the surface and in the bulk of the channel, as quantified by the dimensionless Dukhin number Du =  $\Sigma/ehc$ , which compares the surface charge S with the charge density in the bulk of the electrolyte, ec. Expressed numerically, activated carbon channels typically have a Du of ~10<sup>2</sup> to 10<sup>3</sup>, showing that surface effects strongly dominate the bulk effects. Equation 3 then predicts a memory time in the range of  $\tau\_m$  ~ Du ×  $\tau\_{\text{diff}}$  ~ 100 s. This estimation is in agreement with experimental values, which were found to be in the range of  $\tau\_m$  ~ 50 to 400 s (figs. S12 and S14), and is consistent with previous reports of extremely slow diffusion of ions near a chemically active surface (31). Our prediction was found to generally underestimate experimental values: This can be attributed to the fact that our model assumes independent successive adsorption events, whereas, in reality, they tend to be correlated over long time scales (32). Moreover, this surface-driven mechanism could explain the disappearance of the phenomenon at low pH (fig. S16), which is known to greatly influence the channels' surface charge (16). The observed dependence of the memristor effect with the electrolyte could likewise result from a difference in chemical affinity between the various species of ions considered and surface defects (figs. S9 and S14)—however, this dependence is hard to analyze and would require further knowledge of the chemical nature of adsorption sites.

We note that this slow "stop-and-go" motion of ions near the channel's surface is not incompatible with the high conductance of activated carbon channels; although surface processes such as adsorption can slow down conductance changes, they do not modify the overall large number of ions present in the channel because of its strong surface charge. We explain how to link conductance to surface charge in the SM (section 3.2). Similarly, we observe that the slowdown of the dynamics on the time scale of minutes emerges from microscopic processes (adsorbing events) with molecular time scales (say, 1 ms at best). This is, however, reminiscent of previous studies that showed how chemical or physical surface processes, involving the Stern layer, can result in hour-long phenomena when coupled to a water flow (33, 34).

The red solid line is a guide for the eye. (Inset) Applied voltage as a function of time. The red arrow indicates the beginning of the voltage spike. (C) Long-term modification of a nanochannel's conductance. Thirty write spikes (+1 V, 10 s) were applied, followed by 30 erase spikes (-1 V, 10 s), which brought the system back to its initial state. Between each spike, the conductance was allowed to stabilize for 2 min and was then measured with a read pulse (0.1 V, 5 s) (see fig. S3). All data correspond to activated carbon channels with height h = 5 nm filled with 1 mM CaCl2.

A similar argument can be formulated for unipolar memristors. This time, the conduction state of the system is encoded in the number of ions that are not part of a tightly bound pair (and can therefore contribute to current) according to the Wien effect. Similarly to surface adsorption, one expects that successive pairing-unpairing events will create a stop-andgo motion of ions through the system (Fig. 2C). The memory time is then, again, found to be given by diffusion multiplied by a ratio of pairing and unpairing times, potentially reaching minute- or even hour-long time scales.

Building on this qualitative picture, one may propose a minimal model, accounting for the memristor effect over minute-long times for both memory types, as detailed in the SM (fig. S7). We found that the system's conductance at time t was given by the convolution of its quasistatic conductance, as given by Eqs. 1 and 2, depending on memristor type, with an exponential memory kernel

$$G(t) = \left[ {}^{\text{v}}G\_{\mathbb{P}^{\mathfrak{g}}}[V(t-s)]\frac{e^{-s/\mathfrak{t}}}{\mathfrak{t}}\text{d}s \right. \qquad (4)$$

where Gqs is quasistatic (nonlinear) conductance,  $V(t)$  the applied voltage, and  $\tau$  a time scale of the order of the memory time  $\tau$ m. The resulting prediction was in good agreement with experimental data (Fig. 3, A and B). According to this simple model, measuring the loop in the I-V curve allowed the characterization of the memristive effect (Fig. 3C). The curve of area as a function of voltage frequency exhibited a maximum when the frequency matched the intrinsic memory time tm, akin to a resonance. The comparison to the prediction of the model again showed good agreement and provided a direct measurement of  $\tau\_m$  (Fig. 3C).

#### Hebbian learning with nanofluidic memristors Reversible modification of a nanochannel's conductance

This qualitative and quantitative rationalization of the ionic memristor effects paves the way for the implementation of learning algorithms using our nanofluidic devices. As a proof of concept, we show that these devices could be used to emulate some basic functionalities found in biological synapses. Because their memory was not lost when voltage was reset to zero, we only focused on bipolar memristors, as exhibited here with activated carbon channels. We first confirmed that their conductance could be increased or lowered through successive voltage sweeps of a given polarity (Fig. 4A). After a positive spike, the conductance was abruptly increased for a short period (~1 min) before relaxing to a long-term value above its initial state (Fig. 4B). This result shows that our device displayed both shortand long-term memory, similar to biological synapses (35).

These neural connections act as resistors whose conductance can be tuned during learning processes, with reversible modifications both on short (milliseconds to minutes) and long (minutes to hours or more) time scales (36, 37). The latter, known as long-term potentiation (or depression, when the conductance is lowered) enables the storage of information through the synapse's conductance state as a form of in-memory coding. Although the exact biological mechanisms are still debated, the transport and accumulation of calcium ions at specific places play a key role (26, 38). Taking inspiration from these features, we designed a protocol to implement in-memory computations with our nanofluidic channel (Fig. 4C). We incremented a nanochannel's conductance by applying a "write" voltage spike (+1 V for 10 s). It could then be accessed by a "read" pulse (+0.1 V for 5 s), which did not modify its value. It could also be reset to its original value with an "erase" spike (–1 V for 10 s). This setup allowed for a versatile and reversible modification and access to the stored value for computational applications. As a proof of concept, we show in Fig. 4C that the modification process was indeed fully reversible and allowed the storage of an analog variable over long time scales, by applying a series of 60 write and erase spikes. We thus demonstrated that nanoscale channels could be "programmed" through the tuning of their conductance, enabling the implementation of in-memory operations with ion-based nanofluidic systems.

#### Hebbian learning algorithm

Building on the similarities between our nanofluidic system and synapses, we next implemented a basic form of Hebbian learning. In biological neuron networks, this process consists of the modification of synaptic weights depending on the relative activation timings of two neurons connected by a given synapse (Fig. 5A). If the presynaptic neuron repeatedly emits an action potential shortly before the activation of the postsynaptic neuron, the synapse is strengthened (meaning its conductance is increased), as this result suggests a form of causality between the two activation events. Conversely, the synapse is weakened (i.e., its conductance is decreased) if the firing order is reversed, which would point at some anticausality relation. These modifications occur even if the presynaptic neuron only causes a mild response (when it is too weak to initiate

(A) Hebb's law in biological synapses: A synapse's conductance increases (decreases) when its presynaptic neuron fires just before (after) the postsynaptic one [adapted from (40)]. This process implements a form of causality detection known as spike timing–dependent plasticity (STDP). (Inset) Rat hippocampal neuron (ZEISS Microscopy from Germany, CC BY 2.0). (B) Hebb's law with nanofluidic memristors: Voltage spikes were applied to a nanochannel, mimicking the activation of two neurons A and B. After each spike from the presynaptic (postsynaptic) neuron, a series of erase (write) spikes was applied. (C) Example of voltage spike series depending on whether the presynaptic (i) or postsynaptic (ii) neuron activated first. (D) Conductance change after eight successive activations of the two neurons, in percentage of the initial conductance and as function of the relative activation timing of the neurons.

an action potential by itself) of the postsynaptic one. Altogether, this process implements a form of principal components analysis of the inputs received by the network (39) and is believed to play a major role in learning.

To mimic this mechanism, we designed the experiment illustrated in Fig. 5B. A computer generated a voltage time series that emulated the behavior of two neurons. This time series was then applied to a nanofluidic channel. The activation of the presynaptic neuron A was modeled by a weak positive voltage pulse. Whenever it activated, a flip-flop mechanism was triggered, connecting the channel to a generator E<sup>−</sup> that applied negative voltage spikes. This behavior lasted until the postsynaptic neuron B activated and the system was branched on another generator,  $E\_+$ , applying positive spikes instead. The opposite chain of events occurred if neuron B activated first; in that case, the channel first received positive spikes from  $E\_+$ , followed by negative spikes from  $E\_-$  once neuron A activated. In both cases, the flip-flop reset if a given total amount of time passed since its activation, allowing the process to start over. Further details regarding the implementation are provided in the SM (fig. S4).

If neuron A activated just before neuron B, then the system received a few negative spikes, followed by many positive spikes (Fig. 5C, left panel). Its conductance was thus globally increased. Conversely, when the firing order was reversed, the system received more negative than positive spikes (Fig. 5C, right panel), and its conductance was therefore lowered.

We implemented this protocol in the experiments as follows: We first measured the system's conductance and ran the program, which consisted of eight successive activations of neurons A and B. Their relative spike timing—measured from the onset of the first spike to be triggered to the onset of the second was used as a tunable parameter. Then, we measured the resulting change in conductance. The results are shown in Fig. 5D: When the presynaptic spike was followed (within a 40-s window) by a postsynaptic spike, conductance was increased, resulting in a strengthened connection between the two neurons. Otherwise, if the delay was too great or if the order was reversed, the connection was left unchanged or weakened, respectively. This phenomenology echoes the one observed in biological synapses, where the transient accumulation of certain ionic species triggers various mechanisms that ultimately result in the strengthening of neuron connections (38, 40); here, the accumulation of ions inside the nanochannel directly causes a conductance increase.

In this study, 2D nanochannels exhibited long-term memory, in the form of a memristor effect that could have two different physical origins—strong correlations between ions or entrance effects. In both cases, memory was retained over long time scales through interfacial processes that slowed down advection–diffusion across the channel. We fully characterized, experimentally and theoretically, both of these mechanisms. In particular, we showed that they may be harnessed for iontronics applications in a variety of contexts, as the memory effect was observed in all tested experimental conditions (salt concentration, electrolyte, pH). These systems reproduced the tunability of synapses, through an accumulation (or depletion) of ions, and could implement basic learning algorithms such as Hebb's rule within a simple nanofluidic architecture. More generally, our work illustrates how confinement-induced effects could be harnessed to build ionic machines inspired by biological systems. This work paves the way for the development of more complex iontronic devices on nanofluidic chips with advanced circuitry. Furthermore, the use of water and ions in the nanofluidic memristors, which is shared by biological systems, suggests the possibility to interface artificial channels with biological ones.
